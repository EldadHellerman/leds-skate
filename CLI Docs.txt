commands will be seperated using ';'.
newlines are ignored:
spaces are ignored unless:
    - in function names - "se t"
	- in ints, where theyre used as a delimiter - "1 2" is 1, and then 2, not 12.

{} are used for a rgb values in dec seperated with ',' - "{255, 0, 01}" is red.

[] are used for arrays, in which ',' is a seperator - [0 , ffff00 ,{255, 0 ,6} ]

datatypes:
	- int is a number - "12" || " 34  "
	- color is a color - "#ff0056" || "{ 34,143, 200 }"
	
functions:
	set(int place, color c, int millis); //sets leds in place $place to color $color within $millis milliseconds without holding
	
	set(color[] colors, int millis); //sets leds begining from led 0 to $colors in array within $millis milliseconds without holding
	
	delay(int millis); //waits for $millis milliseconds before executing next command

valid code:
	set (  12 ,  {  255,  0,  23 }  , 0);
	set  (  [0,0,0, {67,124, 255} ,ff0067,23, 5] ,  4561);
	
TODO:

TODO MAYBE:
	use spaces as seperaters in arrays ("[]") and color trilets ("{}").
	add a boolean to set() that determines if it holds while executing (waits for transition to finish) or not.
